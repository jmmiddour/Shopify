Why do you want to work for Shopify?
What do you want to tell the Hiring Manager?

- I would like to work for Shopify because I want to be able to work with a company that is making it easier for small businesses to make it in the massive world of the internet. People have so many choices when making purchases nowadays. I have been in the shoes of a small online business owner before and I know how hard it is to set yourself apart from other online sellers. I would love to be a part of a team that helps people to do this.

Tell us about a time you messed up and what you learned from it.

- On my first "build week" project here at Lambda School, I was tasked with finding my own dataset to do exploratory data analysis on and tell a story about. I jumped in feet first without concerning myself too much with time and wanted to find that "perfect" dataset. I even self-taught myself how to scrape the web to get my own data. However, being that I wanting it to be the "perfect" dataset, I could not settle. I started to run out of time quickly, the deadline was approaching fast, and I had not even settled on one dataset yet. I almost did not get my project turned in on time and had to work on it every waking hour I had, up to the very last minute. 

    What I learned from this mistake is that perfection is not always possible, but a wonderful thing to strive towards, once you have met your MVP. Another thing that I took away from this experience was to pace myself more efficiently. If I find myself working too long on one thing, just to try to make it perfect, but it works, it is time to move on to the next task and I can always go back later and work on it more, if time allows me to.

If you were to open a Shopify store, what would you sell and why?

- I would sell my handmade jewelry. I loved making the jewelry and really enjoyed it when I received feedback from others about how much they enjoyed it. However, it just became too much to handle between trying to keep the website going, running my flea market store every weekend, making the jewelry, listing on all the different sites trying to get my name out there, and being a mom. Not to mention the cost of listing on all those other sites, the flea market storefront I maintained, my website, and the credit card and PayPal fees.

Any last thoughts?

- I am very passionate about working in the field of Data Science, mostly in the Data Engineering side of it. I took the GCA as a requirement for my graduation from Lambda School already and I scored a 713 it. I have almost completed my CS50 course through Harvard University. I am working on my final project now. I am currently on track to graduate from Lambda in just under 2 months (around the end of June). I have been a stay-at-home mom for the past 13 years and have owned 2 of my own online businesses over the past 20 years. I have chosen this career path at this time in my life because I really feel like it suits me and I thoroughly enjoy doing it.
